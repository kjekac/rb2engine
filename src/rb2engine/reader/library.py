"""Compose the reader modules into a complete SourceLibrary.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
`scan`, `pdb`, `anlz` and `artwork` were each built and tested in isolation.
Every one of them passed its own suite while the pipeline did not connect end
to end: nothing joined a track to its ANLZ files, so no beatgrid or cue ever
reached the IR. This module is that join, and it is deliberately thin — all
the real work lives in the modules it calls.

The join key is `SourceTrack.analyze_path` (pdb `ofs_strings[14]`), e.g.
``/PIONEER/USBANLZ/P02B/00003DA7/ANLZ0000.DAT``. Without it a track has
metadata but no performance data, which is the entire point of the tool.

    with_anlz:
        Read beatgrids/cues. Disable to inspect metadata quickly.
    with_artwork:

        file, which dominates runtime on a large library.
    on_progress:
        Optional ``(phase, done, total)`` sink. The per-track loop below opens
        two or three files per track over USB, so on a real library this is
        the difference between a visible conversion and a silent one.
