"""PQTZ/PQT2 → compressed Engine beat markers; -4 normalization; default vs adjusted grids.

rekordbox lists EVERY beat (~550 for a 6-min track). Engine wants SPARSE markers
with tempo implied by (Δsample_offset)/(Δbeat_number) between adjacent markers.

Algorithm (aligned with libdjinterop normalize_beatgrid + convert write path):
1. Simplify the dense timestamp geometry while bounding reconstruction error.
2. Shift the first marker so its beat index is -4 (Engine convention).
3. Extrapolate the last marker to the first beat past total_samples.
4. number_of_beats on each non-final marker = next.beat_number - this.beat_number.

Downbeat: when the dense list starts on beat_in_bar==1, indices after -4
normalization keep downbeats on beat_number ≡ 0 (mod 4).
