"""Tests for writer/paths.py — PM-1 Track.path strategy.

Why these cases exist:
- engine-lib is the DEFAULT because Engine's desktop library stores
  ../-escaping relative paths rooted at Engine Library/. Audio on this stick
  lives at <drive>/Contents/... while m.db is at
  <drive>/Engine Library/Database2/m.db, so stored paths become
  ../Contents/... . That geometry is the project's top open risk (PM-1):
  Engine's own exporter copies into Engine Library/Music/ instead, so this
  configuration is one Engine's tooling never produces.
- absolute must never be the default: a stick with absolute paths breaks the
  moment it mounts at a different path, and no oracle in this project would
  catch that regression.
- Forward slashes always: Engine and the sqlite file are cross-platform; a
  Windows backslash in Track.path is a latent missing-file bug on players.
- Paths outside drive_root must raise rather than emit a silently wrong
  relative string that would show as missing in Engine.
