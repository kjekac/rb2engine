"""W1 provenance: fingerprint at read time, journal at publish, attribution in verify.

WHY: a real conversion published playlist entries the settled export.pdb did not
contain (torn read, 14 s after rekordbox's last write), and a later incident saw
a "successful" convert drop its report into the source repo with the drive
unmounted. Nothing recorded which bytes any m.db was built from, so verify could
only blame the database. These tests pin the whole evidence chain: the hash is
taken over the buffer actually parsed, it travels via journal + report, and
verify uses it to name which oracle moved — without ever letting staleness
launder a source-independent defect (broken chain, undecodable blob) into
"re-run convert".
